<h4>Some Tips and Tricks to help with efficient programming</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        To replace a list inplace use list[:],
        Example: nums = [1,2,3,4]; nums[:] = [x*2 for x in nums]; This list comprehension will replace the original nums and not create a copy.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you want to get the count of possible pairs in a list (See Leetcode 2001), using 2 loops increases time complexity.
        Instead use Combinations (From PnC). i.e. n!/((n-k)!k!) where, n = count of similar items, and k = number of elements to choose (Pair = 2, triplet = 3..)
        Example: pairlist = [1,3,4,4,5,4,4,6];
        We want the total count of pairs that have the same values (4 at index 2 and 4 at index 3 is 1 pair. Similarly, 4 at index 3 and 4 at index 5 is another pair)

        Method 1:
        count = 0

        #Intitialize Dictionary
        count_dict = {}

        #Iterate over list
        for element in pairlist:
        #If key is found add 1 to value, if not initialize key with value of 0
            count_dict[element[0] / element[1]] = 1 + count_dict.get(element[0] / element[1], 0)

        for val in count_dict.values():
            if val > 1:
        #Combinations is here!!! Since we're taking a pair (only 2), we use below formula
                count += (val * (val-1))//2


        Method 2:
        from collections import Counter
        from itertools import combinations

        count_dict = dict(Counter(pairlist))

        for key,val in count_dict.items():
            if val > 1:
                len(list(combinations([key]*vals, 2))
    </li>
    <li>
        Creating a dictionary and initializing values
        create_dict = {}
        create_dict[key] = create_dict.get(key, Value to intialize with if key is not present in dictionary)
    </li>

</ul>
